    <h1>Analysis of Australian Airports: Size & Elevation</h1>

    <!-- Section 1: Map of Australian Airports -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Map of Australian Airports: Airport Size and Elevation</h2>
        <img src="final_map.png" alt="Map of Australian Airports: Airport Size and Elevation">
        <p>This map provides a comprehensive overview of the spatial distribution of airports across Australia, categorized by size (small, medium, and large) and elevation. Each airport is represented by a colored dot, where green indicates small airports, blue represents medium airports, and red signifies large airports. The size of each dot is proportional to the airport’s elevation, giving an additional layer of information about altitude.
        <br><br>
        From the visualization, it's evident that small airports are scattered across both coastal and inland areas, serving remote and rural communities. Medium airports, while more concentrated around major population centers, can also be found inland, providing essential regional connectivity. Large airports, identified by red dots, are predominantly located near major cities and metropolitan areas, such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, highlighting their importance in facilitating international and long-haul flights. Elevation, indicated by the size of the dots, becomes particularly relevant for airports in the northern and southeastern parts of the country, where hilly or mountainous terrain may impose additional operational challenges.</p>

    <!-- Section 2: Top 10 Largest Airports by Elevation -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Top 10 Largest Airports by Elevation</h2>
        <img src="to_largets.png" alt="Top 10 Largest Airports by Elevation">
        <p>This bar chart shows the largest airports by elevation in Australia, ranked from highest to lowest. Elevation is an important factor for airport design and operation, as it influences the performance of aircraft, particularly during takeoff and landing. Higher altitude airports typically require longer runways due to the lower air density, which reduces engine performance and aerodynamic lift.
        <br><br>
        The highest elevated airports in Australia are primarily located in mountainous regions. Charlotte Pass Medical Centre HLS and Perisher Valley Medical Centre Helipad, for example, are positioned at high altitudes to support medical and emergency services in alpine areas. This is essential for remote communities and for providing access to recreational areas such as ski resorts. The prominence of helicopter landing sites among the highest airports underscores the role of helicopters in accessing difficult or isolated terrain. This chart helps us understand how geographic and environmental factors impact airport infrastructure and the provision of services in high-altitude locations.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Top 10 Medium Airports by Elevation -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Top 10 Medium Airports by Elevation</h2>
        <img src="top_medium.png" alt="Top 10 Medium Airports by Elevation">
        <p>This visualization presents the medium-sized airports with the highest elevation in Australia. These airports serve as vital hubs for regional transportation and often connect remote or rural areas with larger metropolitan cities.
        <br><br>
        Mount Hotham Airport, located in the Victoria Alps, is the highest medium-sized airport in Australia. It is a key transport hub for tourists visiting ski resorts during winter. Similarly, other airports like Armidale and Glen Innes, located in highland regions, play a critical role in connecting these inland regions to the rest of the country. Due to their high elevation, aircraft performance must be carefully managed, particularly during takeoff and landing in potentially colder, more challenging climates. These airports enable commerce, tourism, and emergency services in regions that would otherwise be challenging to access.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Top 10 Smallest Airports by Elevation -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Top 10 Smallest Airports by Elevation</h2>
        <img src="top_smallest.png" alt="Top 10 Smallest Airports by Elevation">
        <p>This chart highlights the smallest airports by elevation in Australia, many of which are located at or near sea level. These airports are primarily found in coastal or island regions, where elevation is minimal. These airports play a vital role in ensuring access to isolated communities, often located on islands or in regions with limited land transportation options.
        <br><br>
        Coconut Island Airport, for example, services a small island community in the Torres Strait, providing crucial links for goods, services, and emergency evacuations. Many of the airports listed in this category are integral for connecting Australia’s remote islands with the mainland, ensuring access to essential services, healthcare, and travel. Despite their small size and low elevation, these airports are vital lifelines for the communities they serve. The relatively low elevations indicate easier takeoff and landing conditions, but these airports may also be more susceptible to environmental challenges, such as rising sea levels or flooding.</p>

    <!-- Section 5: Top 10 Municipalities by Number of Airports -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Top 10 Municipalities by Number of Airports</h2>
        <img src="trying.png" alt="Top 10 Municipalities by Number of Airports">
        <p>This line graph illustrates the top 10 municipalities in Australia ranked by the number of airports within their boundaries. Municipalities such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane lead the list with the highest number of airports. The presence of multiple airports reflects the strategic importance of these cities as major transportation hubs for both domestic and international flights.
        <br><br>
        For instance, Sydney, being a global city, not only has the main international airport but also numerous smaller airports that support business, cargo, and private aviation. The number of airports in these municipalities underscores their economic importance, facilitating tourism, trade, and regional connectivity. The distribution of airports within these municipalities also indicates their capacity to manage high volumes of air traffic, connecting Australia to the world and ensuring that passengers and cargo can move efficiently across the country. Smaller cities such as Hobart and Cairns, despite having fewer airports, serve important roles in regional and international aviation, particularly in supporting tourism and freight industries.</p>
